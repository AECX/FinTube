## Dependencies

Tubefin requires [YouTube-DL/YouTube-DLP](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [id3v2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/id3v2/) for full functionality, however YT-DLP is sufficient for operation.

Check the link above to install YT-DLP and install id3v2:

- Debian/Ubuntu `# sudo apt install id3v2`
- Arch `# sudo pacman -S id3v2`

For other OS please check your package manager.
